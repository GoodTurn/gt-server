Things to fix on backend:

(1) https
(2) postgres has built-in sorting of longitude and latitude. We need to implement that functionality and get rid of the manual code
(3) perform login actions on backend
(4) reformat schema to get rid of JSON storage
(5) reformat schema to add service functionality
